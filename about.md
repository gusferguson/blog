The [Open Microscopy Environment](http://www.openmicroscopy.org) develops
open-source software and data format standards for the storage and
manipulation of biological microscopy data. It is a joint project between
universities, research establishments, industry and the software development
community.

This blog is written by various members of the OME team and hosted via GitHub.
It is based on [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com), a theme for
[Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) which provides a fully furnished
Jekyll setup.
